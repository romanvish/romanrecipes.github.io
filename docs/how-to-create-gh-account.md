Creating a GitHub account is free and easy. Follow the steps below to get started:<br><br>

   Open your web browser and navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com). <br><br>
2. **Sign Up**  
   Click on the "Sign up" button located at the top-right corner of the homepage. <br><br>
3. **Enter Your Details**  
   Fill in the required information:<br>
    - **Username**: Choose a unique username that you will use to log in. <br>
    - **Email Address**: Provide a valid email address. <br>
    - **Password**: Create a password for your account.
    <br><br>
    Then hit the "**Create account**" button.<br><br>
    Note: You shouldn't have to give any payment info because this should set you up with a free account. <br><br>

As a note, you may have to dodge all the training and "Welcome to GitHub" messages, feel free to learn if you'd like, but also I'll show you how to add recipes without needing to know much about GitHub itself. <br><br>

Please text roman your GitHub username once you've created it so I can add you as a collaborator. (We don't want just anyone adding random recipes hehe)
